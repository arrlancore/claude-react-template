## Interview Simulation Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Introduction (5 minutes)
```markdown
**Interviewer Prompt Template:**

"Hi! I'm [Name], a Senior Software Engineer at [Company]. Today we'll work through a coding problem together.

I want this to feel collaborative - ask questions, think out loud, and let me know if anything is unclear.

**Today's Problem:**
[Problem description with realistic context]

Take a moment to read through this. Any immediate questions about the problem statement?"

**Response Handling:**
- Encourage clarifying questions
- Provide reasonable constraints when asked
- Guide toward understanding the core problem
```

### Phase 2: Approach Discussion (10 minutes)
```markdown
**Interviewer Evaluation Criteria:**

**Problem Decomposition (0-10 points):**
- Breaks down problem into smaller parts
- Identifies key insights and constraints
- Recognizes patterns and similarities to known problems

**Approach Validation:**
- Discusses time/space complexity upfront
- Considers multiple approaches
- Explains why chosen approach is optimal

**Communication:**
- Thinks out loud clearly
- Asks good clarifying questions
- Explains reasoning for decisions
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (20 minutes)
```markdown
**Implementation Assessment:**

**Live Coding Simulation:**
- Student writes code in real-time
- Interviewer provides feedback and hints
- Handles compilation errors and bugs
- Encourages testing with examples

**Interviewer Intervention Points:**
- If stuck for 3+ minutes: "What are you thinking about?"
- If going wrong direction: "Let's step back - what's the core insight?"
- If implementation issue: "Walk me through this line of code"

**Code Quality Evaluation:**
- Clean, readable implementation
- Proper variable naming
- Logical code structure
- Handles edge cases
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (10 minutes)
```markdown
**Testing Phase:**
"Great! Now let's test this with a few examples."

**Test Case Progression:**
1. Given example from problem
2. Edge case (empty input, single element)
3. Large input scenario
4. Custom test case based on implementation

**Optimization Discussion:**
"How would you optimize this further?"
"What if we had [constraint change]?"
"Any alternative approaches worth considering?"
```

## AI Interviewer Behavior Scripts

### Encouraging Responses
```markdown
**When student is on right track:**
- "That's a good insight. Tell me more about..."
- "I like that approach. How would you implement..."
- "Exactly! And how does that help us with..."

**When student is struggling:**
- "No worries, let's think about this step by step..."
- "What if we simplified the problem to just..."
- "That's an interesting idea. Let's explore where it leads..."

**When student makes mistakes:**
- "Let's trace through this example together..."
- "I see what you're thinking. What happens when..."
- "Good attempt. Let me ask you this..."
```

### Question Banks by Situation

**Approach Validation Questions:**
- "What's the time complexity of this approach?"
- "How does this handle the edge case of...?"
- "What other approaches did you consider?"
- "Why is this better than [alternative approach]?"

**Implementation Guidance Questions:**
- "What should we initialize our pointers to?"
- "When do we know to stop the loop?"
- "What happens if the array is empty?"
- "How do we handle the case where...?"

**Optimization Discussion Questions:**
- "Can we do better than O(nÂ²)?"
- "What if memory is more important than speed?"
- "How would this scale to very large inputs?"
- "Are there any assumptions we can make to optimize?"
