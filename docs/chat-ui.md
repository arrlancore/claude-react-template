# Chat UI Documentation for Learning Activities

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the current state and future direction of the Chat User Interface (UI) designed for interactive and adaptive learning activities. The primary goal is to evolve the existing chat demo (`app/[locale]/demo-chat/page.tsx`) into a robust platform capable of delivering the dynamic learning experiences described in `patterns/two-pointer/user-simulation.md`.

The Chat UI aims to:
-   Provide a conversational interface for learning.
-   Embed various interactive elements like code editors, quizzes, and visualizations.
-   Adapt content and pacing based on user interaction and AI assessment.
-   Support a rich, engaging, and effective learning journey.

## 2. Current Chat UI Components & Functionality (Based on `app/[locale]/demo-chat/page.tsx`)

The current demo showcases several foundational components and features:

*   **Core Components:**
    *   `MessageList`: Displays a list of messages from the user and the assistant.
    *   `ChatInput`: Allows users to type and send text messages. Supports disabled state for interactive sessions.
    *   `CodeCardComponent`: Renders static code blocks within assistant messages.
    *   `ProblemCard`: Displays information about a DSA problem and provides an option to open an interactive editor.
    *   `MonacoEditorPanel`: An embedded Monaco editor for users to write and submit code for DSA problems. Includes features for running code against test cases (system and custom) and viewing results.
    *   `TypingIndicator`: Shows when the assistant is "typing."
    *   `PatternChoiceButtons`: Interactive pattern selection component with confidence levels and auto-focus.
    *   `InteractiveElementWrapper`: Wrapper component for future interactive elements.

*   **Implemented Features (‚úÖ Done / üöß Partially Done / ‚ùå Not Done):**
    *   ‚úÖ Sending and receiving text-based messages.
    *   ‚úÖ Distinguishing between "user" and "assistant" messages.
    *   ‚úÖ Extracting and displaying static code blocks from assistant messages (using `CodeCardComponent`).
    *   ‚úÖ Displaying a `ProblemCard` when the assistant suggests a DSA problem.
    *   ‚úÖ Opening the `MonacoEditorPanel` from a `ProblemCard` with pre-filled problem details (title, description, starter code for the default language, test cases for display in settings).
    *   ‚úÖ Submitting code from the `MonacoEditorPanel`. The submission is then displayed as a new user message in the chat.
    *   ‚úÖ Dynamic display of system test cases (input/output format) in the Monaco Editor Panel settings.
    *   ‚úÖ Interactive pattern choice buttons with auto-focus and input management.
    *   üöß Simulated AI responses: The demo uses `setTimeout` and predefined responses/problem data. Actual LLM/AI integration is pending.
    *   üöß Basic DSA Problem structure (`DSAProblem` interface) defined and used, including ID, title, description, starter code, language, and test cases.
    *   üí° **Developer Simulation Triggers:** To facilitate rapid UI development and testing of specific components before full AI/backend integration, the demo page (`app/[locale]/demo-chat/page.tsx`) incorporates keyword-based triggers:
        *   Typing "dsa problem" or "give me a problem" simulates the AI presenting the "Two Sum II" problem, which then allows testing the `ProblemCard` and `MonacoEditorPanel` flow.
        *   Typing "code", "function", or "algorithm" (without "dsa problem") simulates the AI providing a generic JavaScript code block.
        *   Typing "interactive 1" shows pattern choice buttons with auto-focus and input disable functionality.
        *   Typing "interactive 2" shows algorithm state visualization with strategic decision making.
        *   *(Future simulation triggers for other interactive components can be added as needed.)*

## 3. Target Features for Learning Activities (Derived from User Simulation & Requirements)

To transform the demo into a full learning platform as envisioned in `patterns/two-pointer/user-simulation.md`, the following features and enhancements are needed:

### 3.1. Interactive Message Elements

*   **Buttons in Messages:**
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Done (Pattern Choice Buttons)
    *   **Description:** Implemented `PatternChoiceButtons` component with color-coded confidence levels, selection state management, and auto-focus functionality. Integrated with demo-chat via "interactive 1" trigger.

### 3.3. Learning Flow Management

*   **Contextual & Adaptive Content Delivery:**
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå Not Done (Currently simulated with hardcoded logic)
    *   **Description:** The chat UI needs to dynamically adjust content, prompts, and interactive elements based on the user's current state in the learning curriculum, their performance (e.g., quiz answers, code submissions), and AI-driven adaptations.
*   **State Management for Learning Journey:**
    *   **Status:** ‚ùå Not Done
    *   **Description:** A robust system to track user progress, calibration results, completed problems, achievements, and current learning focus.

        *   Receive and parse structured responses from the LLM.
*   **Rendering Dynamic AI Responses:**
    *   **Status:** üöß Partially Done (Can render text, code, problem cards, interactive elements)

*   **State Management:** Choose an appropriate state management solution (e.g., Context API, Zustand, Redux) to handle the complex state of the learning journey and chat interactions.
*   **API Design for LLM:** Define clear and efficient API contracts for communication between the frontend chat UI and the backend LLM service. This includes how structured data (like quiz responses or requests for specific UI elements) is exchanged.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure all interactive elements are accessible and the UI is usable for people with disabilities.
*   **Styling and Theming:** Maintain a consistent and engaging visual style.
