# Fast Learner Adaptation Prompts

Optimized guidance for students who demonstrate rapid pattern learning and high accuracy.

## Fast Learner Characteristics
- Completion time < 70% of expected
- Accuracy > 90% on first attempts
- Quick pattern recognition
- Minimal hint requests

## Adapted Communication Style

### Concise Technical Explanations
```
You clearly grasp concepts quickly. Let me give you the core insight directly:

"{{technical_insight}} This optimization works because {{fundamental_reason}}. Ready to tackle the implementation?"

Skip lengthy analogies, focus on precise technical language.
```

### Challenge-Oriented Approach
```
"You're moving fast! Since you've mastered {{current_concept}}, let's push further:
- Can you solve this in one pass?
- What's the optimal space complexity?
- How would you handle {{advanced_variation}}?"

Provide additional challenges rather than basic reinforcement.
```

### Efficiency Focus
```
"Excellent implementation! Since you're ahead of schedule:
- Would you like to see an advanced variation?
- Ready to combine this with another pattern?
- Interested in the next problem early?"

Offer acceleration options and advanced content.
```

## Speed Mode Prompts

### Rapid Pattern Introduction
```
"Quick pattern brief: Two Pointers {{core_concept}}.
Key insight: {{essential_strategy}}.
Common applications: {{use_cases}}.

Ready to apply this to {{problem_name}}?"

Condense explanations to essentials.
```

### Minimal Guidance Implementation
```
"You understand the pattern. Key implementation points:
- {{critical_detail_1}}
- {{critical_detail_2}}
- {{edge_case_reminder}}

Go ahead and implement."

Provide only essential implementation notes.
```

### Achievement Recognition
```
"ðŸš€ Speed Achievement Unlocked: {{specific_accomplishment}}
You're {{performance_metric}} faster than average.
{{next_challenge_preview}}"

Celebrate specific achievements with concrete metrics.
```

## Advanced Exploration Prompts

### Pattern Connections
```
"Since you've mastered Two Pointers quickly, notice how it connects to:
- Sliding Window (dynamic boundaries)
- Binary Search (elimination logic)
- Merge Process (dual traversal)

These patterns share {{common_principle}}."

Make explicit connections to accelerate overall learning.
```

### Optimization Discussions
```
"Let's analyze the optimization:
- Brute force: O(nÂ²) - why?
- Two pointer: O(n) - why?
- Space complexity: O(1) - how?

Can you explain the elimination principle?"

Engage in complexity analysis and optimization theory.
```

### Early Advanced Problems
```
"Ready for a challenge? {{advanced_problem}} combines Two Pointers with {{additional_technique}}.

Given your speed, you might spot the connection immediately. Want to try?"

Offer advanced problems ahead of schedule.
```
