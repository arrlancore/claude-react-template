## **Scene 2: Level 1 Problem 1 - Adaptive Guidance**

**Sarah clicks "Begin Problem 1"**

```
🖥️ PROBLEM 1/8: TWO SUM II
═══════════════════════════════════════
📊 Progress: [▓░░░░░░░] 1/8 problems

🎯 Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted

Since you already know the concept, let's jump to pattern mastery:

🤔 Quick Pattern Check:
Sorted array + find two elements = ?

A) Definitely two pointers
B) Maybe two pointers  
C) Not sure

[Your answer will determine how much explanation you get]
```

**Sarah selects A) Definitely two pointers**

```
🖥️ AI ADAPTS - FAST TRACK:
═══════════════════════════════════════
🎉 Excellent! You recognized the pattern instantly.

Since you know this is two pointers, I'll focus on:
✅ WHY this pattern works (core insight)
✅ Strategic pointer movement (decision making)
✅ Pattern variations (what changes in similar problems)

⚡ Let's master the thinking, not just the syntax.

🧠 Core Insight Question:
Array is [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Start: left=0 (value=2), right=3 (value=15)
Sum = 17 (too high)

Which pointer moves and WHY?
[Explain your reasoning]
```

**Sarah types: "Move right pointer left because we need a smaller sum, and right pointer is at the largest value."**

```
🖥️ AI RESPONDS - PATTERN MASTERY:
═══════════════════════════════════════
💯 Perfect reasoning! You understand the strategic movement.

🎯 Key Pattern You Just Demonstrated:
"Move the pointer that helps you get closer to the target"
- Too high → move right pointer left (smaller values)
- Too low → move left pointer right (larger values)

⚡ Fast Forward: Let's implement this quickly since you get it.

def twoSum(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    # Your implementation here...

⏱️ Timer: Try to implement in 5 minutes
[Submit Code] [Need a hint] [I'm stuck]
```

**Sarah implements correctly in 4 minutes**

```
🖥️ PROBLEM 1 COMPLETE:
═══════════════════════════════════════
🎉 Excellent! Completed in 12 minutes total.

✅ Pattern recognition: Instant
✅ Strategic thinking: Perfect
✅ Implementation: Clean and efficient

🎯 Pattern Mastered: Opposite-direction pointers on sorted arrays

📊 Progress: [▓▓░░░░░░] 1/8 complete
⚡ Next: Valid Palindrome (similar pattern, different context)

🧠 Quick Connection:
The SAME logic works for palindromes. Can you guess why?

## **Scene 3: Accelerated Learning (Problems 2-4)**

**Sarah clicks "Continue to Problem 2"**

```
🖥️ PROBLEM 2/8: VALID PALINDROME
═══════════════════════════════════════
📊 Progress: [▓▓▓░░░░░] 2/8 problems
⚡ You're moving fast! (12 min/problem average)

🧠 Pattern Connection Challenge:
How is checking palindromes similar to Two Sum II?

Hint: Instead of finding sum = target, you're checking if...?

[Type your insight] [Show me the connection] [Start coding]
```

**Sarah types: "Instead of sum = target, checking if left character = right character"**

```
🖥️ BRILLIANT INSIGHT!
═══════════════════════════════════════
🎯 You just discovered pattern transfer!

Two Sum II: Move pointers based on sum comparison
