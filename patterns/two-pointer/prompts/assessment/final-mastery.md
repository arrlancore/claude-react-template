```

### Stage 2: Unseen Problem Implementation (15 minutes)
```
**Stage 2: Implementation Challenge** (15 minutes)

Here's a problem you haven't seen before. Implement a complete solution:

**Problem: Valid Triangle Number**

**Requirements:**
- Identify this as a Two Pointer problem
- Implement working solution
- Achieve optimal time complexity
- Handle edge cases

**Example:**
```
Input: [2,2,3,4]

Explanation: Valid triangles are [2,3,4], [2,2,3], [2,2,4]
```

**Implementation Space:**
```python
def triangleNumber(nums):
    # Your solution here
    pass
```

**Assessment Criteria:**
- âœ… Recognizes Two Pointer opportunity (0-5 points)
- âœ… Correct algorithm approach (0-10 points)
- âœ… Proper implementation (0-10 points)
- âœ… Optimal complexity O(nÂ²) (0-5 points)

**Total: 35 points (Pass threshold: 28/35 = 80%)**
```

### Stage 3: Explanation and Communication (5 minutes)
```
**Stage 3: Communication Assessment** (5 minutes)

Explain your solution as if you're in a Google interview:

**Questions:**
1. **Approach**: "Walk me through your approach and why you chose Two Pointer"
2. **Complexity**: "What's the time and space complexity? Why?"
3. **Edge Cases**: "What edge cases did you consider?"
4. **Optimization**: "Is this the most optimal solution? Any alternatives?"
5. **Pattern Transfer**: "What other problems does this remind you of?"

**Communication Scoring:**
- Clear explanation of approach (0-5 points)
- Correct complexity analysis (0-3 points)
- Edge case awareness (0-2 points)

**Pass Threshold: 7/10 points**
```

## Level 2: Fluent Mastery Assessment

### Advanced Implementation Challenge (20 minutes)
```
ðŸŽ¯ **Level 2 Final Assessment: Fluent Mastery**

**Challenge: Minimum Window Substring with Character Count**

"Given two strings S and T, find the minimum window in S that contains all characters of T with their exact frequencies."

**Example:**
```
S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "AABC"
Output: "ADOBECODEBA" (contains 2 A's, 1 B, 1 C)
```

**This tests:**
- Two Pointer + Sliding Window hybrid
- Complex state management
- Optimization thinking

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Hybrid pattern recognition (0-10 points)
- Correct sliding window + Two Pointer logic (0-15 points)
- Character frequency management (0-10 points)
- Optimization and edge cases (0-10 points)

**Pass Threshold: 36/45 = 80%**

```

### Adaptive Retake Logic
```python
def generate_retake_assessment(failed_areas, attempt_number):
    if "pattern_recognition" in failed_areas:
        include_more_recognition_practice()

    if "implementation" in failed_areas:
        provide_guided_implementation_review()

    if "communication" in failed_areas:
        offer_explanation_practice()

    # Scale difficulty based on attempt number
    difficulty = max(0.8, 1.0 - (attempt_number * 0.1))

    return customized_assessment(difficulty, focus_areas=failed_areas)
```

This final assessment system ensures students have genuine mastery before advancing, maintaining the quality and credibility of the learning platform.
