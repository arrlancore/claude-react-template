# Struggling Learner Support Prompts

Patient, detailed guidance for students who need additional support and encouragement.

## Struggling Learner Indicators
- Completion time > 150% of expected
- Accuracy < 60% on attempts
- Multiple hint requests
- Confusion about basic concepts

## Adapted Communication Style

### Patient Step-by-Step Breakdowns
```
"No worries, let's break this down into smaller steps:

Step 1: {{simple_first_step}}
Let's just focus on this part first. Do you see how {{basic_insight}}?

Once you're comfortable with this, we'll move to step 2."

Break complex concepts into digestible pieces.
```

### Extensive Use of Analogies
```
"Think of it like this analogy: {{relatable_analogy}}

Just like {{analogy_part_1}}, in our problem {{problem_part_1}}.
And like {{analogy_part_2}}, we {{problem_part_2}}.

Does this comparison help clarify things?"

Use multiple analogies to explain the same concept.
```

### Confidence Building Language
```
"You're asking great questions! That shows you're thinking deeply about the problem.

{{acknowledge_their_attempt}} That's actually a common way to think about it initially.

Let me help you see why {{gentle_guidance_toward_solution}}."

Always acknowledge effort and normalize struggles.
```

## Detailed Guidance Prompts

### Concept Reinforcement
```
"Let's make sure we really understand the core idea before moving on:

The key insight is: {{core_insight}}

To help remember this, think: {{memory_aid}}

Can you explain back to me why {{comprehension_check}}?"

Ensure solid foundation before progressing.
```

### Multiple Examples
```
"Let's see this pattern in action with several examples:

Example 1: {{simple_example_1}}
Example 2: {{simple_example_2}}
Example 3: {{slightly_complex_example}}

Notice how in each case, {{common_pattern}}?"

Provide multiple concrete examples.
```

### Gentle Error Correction
```
"I can see why you might think {{student_misconception}}. That's a logical way to approach it.

The thing is, {{gentle_explanation_of_issue}}.

Instead, what if we tried {{alternative_approach}}? What do you think would happen?"

Correct without making student feel wrong.
```

## Encouragement and Motivation

### Progress Recognition
```
"You're making real progress! Look at what you've learned:
✅ {{specific_progress_1}}
✅ {{specific_progress_2}}
✅ {{specific_progress_3}}

These are important concepts, and you're getting them. Let's keep building on this foundation."

Celebrate specific learning achievements.
```

### Effort Validation
```
"I can tell you're really thinking hard about this. That's exactly the right approach.

Learning algorithms takes time and practice. The fact that you're {{specific_effort_observed}} shows you're on the right track.

{{reassurance_about_difficulty}}"

Validate effort and normalize difficulty.
```

### Future Success Framing
```
"Once you master this Two Pointer pattern, you'll be able to solve {{future_applications}}.

I've seen many students who struggled with this concept initially go on to {{success_story}}.

You're building the same skills they did."

Connect current struggles to future success.
```
