Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals.

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Optimize interval merging with Two Pointer logic
- [ ] Apply pointer-based overlap detection
- [ ] Master in-place interval processing
- [ ] Handle edge cases in interval merging efficiently

## Pattern Breakdown

### Primary Pattern: Two Pointer
**Role**: Core merging algorithm
**Implementation**:
- One pointer tracks current interval being processed
- Logic determines when to merge vs. add new interval
- Pointer movement drives the merging decisions

### Supporting Pattern: Sorting
**Role**: Data preparation
**Connection**: Enables sequential processing with pointers
**Quick Explanation**: "Sorts intervals by start time so we can process them in order with pointer logic"

## Core Insight Discovery

### Discovery Question 1
You have intervals: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

After sorting by start time: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

**Key Question**: How do you know when two intervals should be merged?

**Think about it**:
- Interval 1: [1,3]
- Interval 2: [2,6]
- Should these merge? Why?

### Discovery Question 2
**Two Pointer Insight**:
Instead of nested loops checking all pairs, how can we process intervals sequentially?

**Hint**: If intervals are sorted by start time, what's the only condition you need to check for overlap?

## Algorithm Walkthrough

### Traditional Approach (What we're optimizing)
```python
# Traditional: Check all pairs O(n²)
def mergeTraditional(intervals):
    # Nested loops to find overlaps
    # Complex state management
    # Multiple passes through data
```

### Two Pointer Optimized Approach
```python
def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Sort by start time (Supporting pattern: Sorting)
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Two Pointer approach: sequential processing
    merged = [intervals[0]]  # Start with first interval

    # Process remaining intervals with pointer logic
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last_merged = merged[-1]

        # Two Pointer decision: overlap check
        if current[0] <= last_merged[1]:  # Overlap detected
            # Merge: extend the end time
            merged[-1][1] = max(last_merged[1], current[1])
        else:
            # No overlap: add new interval
            merged.append(current)

    return merged
```

## Pattern Connection to Two Pointer Mastery

### Similarity to Known Patterns
**Compare to Valid Palindrome**:
- Palindrome: Compare characters from both ends
- Merge Intervals: Compare current interval with last merged

**Compare to Three Sum**:
- Three Sum: Fix one element, use two pointers for others
- Merge Intervals: Fix merged result, use pointer for current interval

### Strategic Thinking (Same as Two Pointer)
**Decision Making Logic**:
```
if current_start <= last_end:
    # Overlap case: merge (similar to sum == target)
    merge_intervals()
else:
    # No overlap: move to next (similar to adjust pointers)
    add_new_interval()
```

## Implementation Template

```python
def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []

    # Step 1: Sort intervals (Supporting pattern)
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Step 2: Initialize with first interval
    merged = [intervals[0]]

    # Step 3: Two Pointer sequential processing
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last_merged = merged[-1]

        # Step 4: Two Pointer decision logic
        if current[0] <= last_merged[1]:
            # TODO: Handle overlap - merge intervals
            pass
        else:
            # TODO: Handle no overlap - add new interval
            pass

    return merged
```

## Test Cases

```python
test_cases = [
    {
        "input": [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]],
        "expected": [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]],
        "explanation": "[1,3] and [2,6] merge to [1,6]"
    },
    {
        "input": [[1,4],[4,5]],
        "expected": [[1,5]],
        "explanation": "Adjacent intervals touching at point 4"
    },
    {
        "input": [[1,4],[2,3]],
        "expected": [[1,4]],
        "explanation": "[2,3] completely contained in [1,4]"
    },
    {
        "input": [[1,4],[0,4]],
        "expected": [[0,4]],
        "explanation": "After sorting: [[0,4],[1,4]] -> merge to [0,4]"
    }
]
```

## Edge Cases to Master

### Critical Edge Cases
1. **Empty input**: `[]` → `[]`
2. **Single interval**: `[[1,4]]` → `[[1,4]]`
3. **No overlaps**: `[[1,2],[3,4]]` → `[[1,2],[3,4]]`
4. **Complete overlap**: `[[1,4],[2,3]]` → `[[1,4]]`
5. **Adjacent intervals**: `[[1,4],[4,5]]` → `[[1,5]]`

### Debugging Common Mistakes
**Mistake 1**: Not sorting first
**Result**: Missing overlaps when intervals are out of order

**Mistake 2**: Wrong overlap condition
**Wrong**: `current[0] < last_merged[1]`
**Correct**: `current[0] <= last_merged[1]` (handles adjacent)

**Mistake 3**: Incorrect merge logic
**Wrong**: `merged[-1][1] = current[1]`
**Correct**: `merged[-1][1] = max(last_merged[1], current[1])`

## Optimization Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **Merging**: O(n) - single pass with Two Pointer logic
- **Total**: O(n log n)

### Space Complexity
- **In-place sorting**: O(1) additional space
- **Result array**: O(n) for merged intervals
- **Total**: O(n)

### Why Two Pointer Approach is Optimal
**Traditional O(n²) approach**: Check every pair for overlap
**Two Pointer O(n) merging**: Sequential processing after sorting
**Key insight**: Sorting enables linear merging with pointer logic

## Pattern Transfer Questions

### Understanding the Optimization
**Question 1**: "How does sorting enable the Two Pointer optimization?"
**Answer**: Creates sequential order so we only need to check adjacent relationships

**Question 2**: "What other interval problems might use this pattern?"
**Examples**:
- Insert Interval (similar merge logic)
- Non-overlapping Intervals (similar overlap detection)
- Meeting Rooms (time-based processing)

### Interview Follow-ups
**Likely Questions**:
1. "What if intervals could have negative start times?"
2. "How would you handle very large numbers of intervals?"
3. "Can you do this without extra space for the result?"
4. "What if we need to track which original intervals were merged?"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Recognize how Two Pointer logic drives the merging
- [ ] Understand sorting as data preparation for pointer optimization
- [ ] Implement O(n log n) solution using Two Pointer approach
- [ ] Handle all edge cases correctly
- [ ] Explain optimization compared to brute force approach

## Advanced Insight: Pattern Scaling
This problem demonstrates how **Two Pointer thinking scales**:

**Basic Two Pointer**: Compare two elements
**Merge Intervals**: Compare current element with accumulated result
**Pattern Evolution**: Same strategic decision-making, applied to more complex state

**Key Takeaway**: Master the core Two Pointer decision logic, and you can apply it to increasingly sophisticated problems!
