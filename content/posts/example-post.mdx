In a groundbreaking achievement for space exploration, SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket on its second orbital test flight today. The massive spacecraft, designed to eventually carry humans to Mars, took off from the Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, at 9:15 AM local time.

## Key Highlights

- Starship reached orbital velocity for the first time
- Both stages of the rocket separated successfully
- The spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean as planned
- No major anomalies were reported during the flight

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk expressed his excitement on social media, stating, "This is a huge step forward for humanity's journey to Mars. I'm incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for their relentless work in making this happen."

## Technical Achievements

The flight demonstrated several critical technologies:

1. Full-flow staged combustion Raptor engines
2. Autogenous pressurization system
3. In-space refueling capability
4. Heat shield tiles for atmospheric reentry

## Expert Reactions

Dr. Emily Johnson, an aerospace engineer at MIT, commented on the launch:
